# Redesigning my portfolio (again)

<span class="inline-block bg-cyan-400 my-8 h-1 w-[5rem]"></span>

I just finished redesigning my portfolio site yet again, but this time will be the last, at least for a while.

My portfolio site has undergone multiple design changes since I deployed the first version back in 2021. I think I just have this obsession with creating an interactive space for my professional endeavors. While I don't believe a portfolio site is necessary for software engineers, having a place to archive the things you've worked on can be beneficial, especially when you want to showcase your skills to clients or recruiters. Of course, platforms like GitHub are superior since they directly link to the source code of projects, but I also value having full control over the presentation. Additionally, I want to feature closed-source projects as well.

I think this latest redesign has the right blend of a clean and modern look, without relying too much on flashy animations. I'd like to keep it this way.
